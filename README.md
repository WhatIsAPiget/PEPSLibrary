PEPS Library  
16 January 2020

The PEPS Library is a C++ implementation of all standard Matrix Product State (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) algorithms.
It requires BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK.

The PEPS Library was programmed by Michael Lubasch when he was a PhD student in the Theory Division of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics where his work was supervised by Prof. Dr. J. Ignacio Cirac and Dr. Mari-Carmen Bañuls.
Michael Lubasch acknowledges support by the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics and the Max Planck Society.
